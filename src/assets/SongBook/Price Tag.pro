{c: Verse}
[F]                           [Am]
Seems like everybody's got a price,
                           [Dm]
I wonder how they sleep at night.
When the sale comes first,
        [Bb]
And the truth comes second,
Just stop, for a minute and
[F]
Smile
                    [Am]
Why is everybody so serious!
               [Dm]
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
         [Bb]
And your heels so high
                               [F]
That you cant even have a good time.
