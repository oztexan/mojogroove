I resisted all my life
Rarely taking your advice
Except occassionally
You'd get the better of me
Or to make a baby
You're naughty and unclean ya

Morning just another day
Standing you salute the day
Have to think of grandma
Or Trump in a bra
Or eye surgery
Make you flaccid and go wee

Oh Randy
When I give into you I feel ashamed
It's in my programming
Oh Randy
You trickster you cannot be trusted
I used you sparingly

I'm standing on the edge of time
Doctor says I'm gonna die
Unless we take it out
It'll spread and take you out
There could be side effects
No woodies but nappies

Oh Randy
Now we face permanant separation
A possiblity
Oh Randy
We should be happy no more fighting
Let's do it amicably
