Instead of hunting or displacing the flocks of wild lorikeets residing in the region, Griffiths sought to redirect their attention from ravaging his prized blooms by providing regular feedings each day.

Situated on one of the highest points of the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains of New South Wales, this property is breathtaking to behold in colour and detail.<\/p>\n<p>Commissioned by Henri van de Velde in the 1930s, Danish horticulturalist and landscaper, Paul Sorenson, was selected to design and create the Everglades due to his enormous talent and sensitivity to the site\u2019s natural atmosphere. The cooler climate of the Blue Mountains supported the European-style design and allowed imported flora to be integrated with native Australian flora. This combination of plants and the landscaping design were reminiscent of European gardens, but with a slice of Australia fitted seamlessly into place, the result was astoundingly beautiful and appealing to the wealthy patrons of the area.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Spend hours roaming the gardens, absorb the astonishingly beautiful views and soak up the tranquillity and peacefulness offered by perfectly maintained yet strikingly natural landscaping.
