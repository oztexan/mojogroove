{t: Crazy - Gnarls Barkley}

[Verse 1]
 
Am                                                      Cmaj7
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                             F
There was something so pleasant about that place.
 
Even your emotions had an echo
               Esus4   E
In so much space
Am
And when you're out there, without care,
                     Cmaj7
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                       F
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                       Esus4  E
I just knew too much
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  Am
Does that make me crazy?
                  C
Does that make me crazy??
                  F
Does that make me crazy???
                  Esus4     E
Possibly.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A                                                F
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
            Cmaj7                    Esus4   E
But think twice, that's my only advice
Am                                                                     C
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                      F
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                             Esus4       E
You really think you're in control
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  Am
Well, I think you're crazy!
                  Cmaj7
I think you're crazy!
                  F
I think you're crazy,
                  Esus4     E
Just like me.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A                                                      F
  My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
            Cmaj7                                Esus4     E
And all I remember is thinking, I wanna be like them
Am                                                                  C
  Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                               F
And it's no coincidence I've come
                        Esus4     E
And I can die when I'm done
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          Am
Maybe I'm crazy
             Cmaj7
Maybe you're crazy
            F
Maybe we're crazy
            Esus4     E
Probably
 
 
[Outro]
 
A   F Cmaj7  Esus4  E  Am
