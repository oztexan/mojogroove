Well, got a silly little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Except that she's gonna make me feel so sad

Hush, hush, I thought I heard you calling my name now
Hush, hush, You broke my heart but that was a dream now
Hush, hush, I thought I heard you call my name now
Hush, hush, you broke my heart but that was a dream now.

Oh, you gotta believe me, honey
I never was a-dreaming

Hush, hush, I thought I heard you calling my name now
Hush, hush, You broke my heart but that was a dream now
Hush, hush, I thought I heard you call my name now
Hush, hush, you broke my heart but that was a dream now.

Early in the morning
and late in the evening
