Abba â€“ Mamma mia

[Intro]
D Daug D Daug x2 (second time with chords)

[Verse 1]
D         A/D        D                       G
I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
D    A/D        D                        G
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
D               Daug
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
D              Daug              G
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
                   A
There's a fire within my soul
G    D/F#  A
Just one   look and I can hear a bell ring
G   D/F# A
One more look and I forget everything,

[Chorus]
D
Mamma mia, here I go again
C/G G               D/G
My  my, how can I resist you?
D
Mamma mia, does it show again?
C/G G                      D/G
My  my, just how much I've missed you

D              A/C#
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm             F#m/A
Blue since the day we parted
C/G  G   Em         A
Why, why did I ever let you go?
D         Bm
Mamma mia, now I really know,
C/G  G   Em            A
My   my, I could never let you go.

[Instrumental]
D Daug D Daug

[Verse 2]
D         A/D       D                             G
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
D       A/D           D                              G
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
D               Daug
And when you go, when you slam the door
D              Daug                  G
I think you know, that you won't be away too long
                  A
You know that I'm not that strong.
G    D/F#  A
Just one   look and I can hear a bell ring
G   D/F# A
One more look and I forget everything,

[Chorus]
D
Mamma mia, here I go again
C/G G               D/G
My  my, how can I resist you?
D
Mamma mia, does it show again?
C/G G                      D/G
My  my, just how much I've missed you
D              A/C#
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm             F#m/A
Blue since the day we parted
C/G  G   Em         A
Why, why did I ever let you go?

D
Mamma mia, even if I say
C/G G                    D/G
Bye bye, leave me now or never
D
mamma mia, it's a game we play
C/G G                   D/G
Bye bye doesn't mean forever

D
Mamma mia, here I go again
C/G G               D/G
My  my, how can I resist you?
D
Mamma mia, does it show again?
C/G G                      D/G
My  my, just how much I've missed you
D              A/C#
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm             F#m/A
Blue since the day we parted
C/G  G   Em         A
Why, why did I ever let you go?

D
Mamma mia, even if I say
C/G G                    D/G
Bye bye, leave me now or never
D
mamma mia, it's a game we play
C/G G                   D/G
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
