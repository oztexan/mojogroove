{t: Would We Do It Again}
{st: Tex}



We stepped out on the sand
bare feet, warm. sfot and calm
Hand in Hand the sky is clear
Shadows past disappear, disappear

Glistening gold in the desert sun
You run, you run You touch the sun

He appears, and appears appears

Would you do it again
Now you know about the pain?
Would you do it again
Now you know about the pain?

Silent choice he disappears
In the whispering wind you hear

When you wished it away
Did you know we'd never meet 
When you wished it away
Did you know we'd never meet 

You walk alone
Pain is gone
Ageless and calm
You walk alone

You walk alone
Pain is gone
Ageless and calm
You walk alone
