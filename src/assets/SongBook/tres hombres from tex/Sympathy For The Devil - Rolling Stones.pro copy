[E]Please allow me to introd[D]uce myself, I'm a m[A]an of wealth and [E]taste
I've been around for long,[D] long years I've stolen [A]many a man's soul and fait[E]h
I was around when Jes[D]us Christ had His m[A/C#]oment[A] of doubt and pai[E]n
I made damn sure that [D]Pilate washed his [A/C#]hands[A] and sealed his fat[E]e[Esus4][E]
[B]Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my[A]  [E]name, [A/E][E]
but what's [B]puzzling you, is [E/B]the [B] nature of m[A]y ga[E]me[Esus4][E]
Stuck around St. [D]Petersburg when I [A]saw it was a time for a chang[E]e
Killed the Tzar and his [D]ministers; Anast[A/C#]asia [A] screamed in vain[E]
I rode a tank held a gen[D]eral's rank when the blit[A/C#]zkrieg [A]raged
and the bo[E]dies stank[Esus4][E]
[B]Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my[A]  [E]name,  O[A/E]h    [E]yeah
Ah what's [B]puzzling you, is [E/B]the [B] nature of my ga[E]me[A/E][E]
[E] I watched with glee while your ki[D]ngs and queens fought for ten[A/C#]   de[A]cades for the gods[E] they made
[Esus4]    I [E]shouted out, "Who killed the [D]Kennedys?" when [A/C#]after all it was [E]you and me[Esus4][E]
Let me please introduce[D] myself I'm a m[A/C#]an   [A]of wealth and tast[E]e [Esus][E]
  And I laid traps for [D]troubadours who get [A/C#]killed before they reached Bom[E]bay[Esus4][E]
[B]Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my[A]  [E]name,   [Esus4]Oh      [E]yeah
But what's [B]puzzling you, is [E/B]the [B] nature of m[A]y ga[E]me   [A/E]       [E]    Well get down

Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for long, long years I've stolen many a man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ had His moments of doubt and pain
I made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's puzzling you, is the
nature of my game
I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was time for a change
I killed the Tzar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a gen'ral's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged and the
bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's puzzling you, is the
nature of my game
I watched with glee while your kings and queens, fought for ten decades for
the gods they made
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?", when after all it was you and me
So let me please introduce myself, I am a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadours, who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's puzzling you, is the
nature of my game
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's confusing you, is
just the nature of my game
Just as every cop is criminal, and all the sinners, Saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer, 'cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse, or I'll lay your soul to waste
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's puzzling you, is the
nature of my game

     Hey is this the right chord placement for this song.  I am just
going off from what I heard on the radio the other day.  I don't have
a recording of the song.
Please make corrections if there are any.
                                Thanks guys.....
