D               A/C#            Bm7                 A 
Your ever lastin' summer, you can see it fadin' fast,
  D                       A/C#            Bm7                 A 
So you grab a piece of somethin' that you think is gonna last.
C#/E                          C/Eb          B/D           A/C# 
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand;
  D                     A/C#            Bm7            A 
The things you think are precious I can't understand.

CHORUS:	Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
|                              Gmaj9                         A 
|	Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
|                           Gmaj9                    A 
|	Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?

  D                            A/C#     Bm7             A 
You been tellin' me you're a genius since you were seventeen;
  D               A/C#               Bm7                        A 
In all the time I've known you I still don't know what you mean.
  C#/E                   C/Eb          B/D              A/C# 
The weekend at the college didn't turn out like you planned;
  D                 A/C#              Bm7           A 
The things that pass for knowledge I can't understand.

CHORUS


  D                     A/C#         Bm7            A 
I've spent a lit of money and I spent a lot of time;
  D                     A/C#      Bm7                A 
The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind.
  C#/E                   C/Eb                B/D          A/C# 
After all the things we've done and seen you find another man;
  D                      A/C#          Bm7         A 
The things you think are useless I can't understand.
