{title: Man In A Box}
{st: Alice in Chains}

        added missing verse and repeated chorus from James Stephan's tab (great version for accousic)

These AREN'T the chords that AIC uses in the actual studio recording, but these are the 
implied chords of the song. I use these in an acoustic version out at the bars. Enjoy!

Half-step down tuning (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb)

----Intro----

Em, D, A, Em
La-la-lala... etc

----Verse----

Em      D          Em
I'm the man in the box
Em     D     A
Buried in my shit

Em    G   D    A   Em
Won't you come and save me, save me

----Chorus---

Em     G     D     A
Feed...   my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Em     G   D         A
Jesus...   Christ, deny your maker
Em   G      D      A
He...   who tries, will be wasted
Em   G      D     A
Feed...  my eyes, now you've sewn them shut


Em      D          Em
I´m the dog who gets beat 
Em     D     A
Shove my nose in shit 
Em    G   D    A   Em
Won´t you come and save me, save me 


Em     G     D     A
Feed...   my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Em     G   D         A
Jesus...   Christ, deny your maker
Em   G      D      A
He...   who tries, will be wasted
Em   G      D     A
Feed...  my eyes, now you've sewn them shut


Em     G     D     A
Feed...   my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Em     G   D         A
Jesus...   Christ, deny your maker
Em   G      D      A
He...   who tries, will be wasted
Em   G      D     A
Feed...  my eyes, now you've sewn them shut
