{c:chorus}
Should I stay or should I go now
Music starts again, fast part
Should I stay or should I go now
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So you gotta let me know

This indecision bothers me                    Esta undecision me molesta
If you don't want me set me free              Si no quieres librame
Exactly who I'm supposed to be                Diga me que tengo ser
Don't you which clothes even fit me           Seves que robas me querda
Come on and let me know                       Me tienes que desir
Should I cool it or should I blow             Me debo ir o quedarme

like first part, same music + screaming

{c:chorus}
Should I stay or should I go now         |   Yahouh !
Should I stay or should I go now         |   YEEPEEE!
If I go there will be trouble            |   Si me voy - va peligro
And if I stay it will be double          |   Me quedo is double
So you gotta let me know		 |   Me tienes que desir
Should I cool it or should I blow        |   Me debo ir o quedarme

{c:chorus again}

Should I stay or should I go now (x 2)
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So you gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go
