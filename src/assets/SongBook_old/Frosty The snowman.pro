{subtitle: }

[Verse 1]
G                          C           G
Frosty the Snow Man, was a jolly happy soul 
       C                   G
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
        D                G
and two eyes made out of coal.

[Verse 2]
G                         C               G
Frosty the Snow Man, is a fairy tale they say
       C                    G        
He was made of snow but the children know 
       C       D7       G
how he came to life one day.


[Bridge]
      C                   Bm             Am                G
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
    D                Dbdim          Em             D
For when they put it on his head he began to dance around.

[Verse 3]
    G                         C               G
Oh, Frosty the Snow Man was alive as he could be, 
        C                     G                        
And the children say he could laugh and play 
         C       D7       G
just the same as you and me.

[Verse 4]
G                               C                G
Frosty the Snow Man,'  knew the sun was hot that day,
      C                           G                        
So he said, "Let's run  and we'll have some fun
      C      D7    G
now before I melt away."
 
[Verse 5]
G                           C                 G
Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
        C                   G                        
Running here and there all around the square,
        C           D7  G
saying "Catch me if you can."

 
[Bridge 2]
   C                 Bm                    Am             G
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop,
       D             Dbdim          Em                 D
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"

[Verse 6]
G                          C            G
Frosty the Snow Man had to hurry on his way,
       C                        G                         
But he waved good-bye, saying, "Don't you cry;
        C     D7        G
I'll be back again some day."

[Ending]
G
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump, 
               D7
Look at Frosty go. 

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump, 
                                               G
over the hills of snow...Oh...Oh...over the hills of snow.
